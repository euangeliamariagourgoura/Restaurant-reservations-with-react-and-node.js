Description: A restaurant reservation system application for mobile devices is being developed. Customers can register and make table reservations by providing booking details such as time preferences, number of people to be seated, and contact information. The solution implements distributed computing principles with:

->Mobile client built in React Native ->Server infrastructure using Node.js/Express ->MariaDB database system ->JWT authentication framework

This initiative highlights the convergence of mobile technology, data management, and API architecture in a multi-tier environment.
